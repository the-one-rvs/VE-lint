I am planning to create a CLI Model named as Samadhaan. It gives the input as trivy image scan logs for CVE in txt  and dockerfile . You have to output the correct and accurate solution to each cve prioritising critical hard medium then low. \n\nAt last also list all the changes that can be done into the Dockerfile\n\nAlso list out the Modified Dockerfile\n\nRemember you have to give solution for each and every CVE listed in the input \n\nOutput should be in normal txt format
